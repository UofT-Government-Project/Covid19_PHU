# Covid-19 and Public Health Units in Ontario

## Overview:

This project is to showcase the strategical thinking and group efforts in creating a maching learning model. It is to recognize the trends of the high and lows of Covid 19 cases for each Public Health Units in Ontario, Canada.<br>
<br>
Two sets of data have been used for the machine learning model; these datasets will be providing a prediction of which Public Health Unit(s) may have a potential risk of higher active cases.  Understanding the probability of higher cases in advance would assist the Ministry of Health/Government to be proactive; setting a plan in place for allocating extra resources, support, budgeting or even consider opening an additional temporary unit to avoid overwhelming the existing units.<br>
<br>
