# Covid19_PHU
## Database Mock-Up
Two data sources were used to create the ERD for our project. The first dataset is the "Status of COVID-19 cases in Ontario by Public Health Unit (PHU)". Columns' details are: _id, FILE_DATE, PHU_NAME, PHU_NUM, ACTIVE_CASES, RESOLVED_CASES and DEATHS. The second dataset titled "Ministry of Health Public Health Unit Boundary" has the following columns: FID, OGF_ID, PHU_ID, NAME_ENG, NAME_FR, GEO_UPD_DT, EFF_DATE, Shape__Area, and Shape__Length.

Primary Keys for both tables are: PHU_NUM for "Status of COVID-19 cases in Ontario by Public Health Unit (PHU)" and PHU_ID for "Ministry of Health Public Health Unit Boundary". Although the names of the columns are different, both columns hold the same numeric unique identifier for each Ontario Public Health Unit. PHU_ID is also a foreign key for "Ministry of Health Public Health Unit Boundary". The tables will be joined using the PHU_NUM and PHU_IDs columns from both tables since they contain the same unique identifiers. Other foreign key assignments are: PHU_NAME in "Status of COVID-19 cases in Ontario by Public Health Unit (PHU)" and NAME_ENG in "Ministry of Health Public Health Unit Boundary".

Once data is merged, cleaned and preprocessed we hope use AWS and ProstreSQL to store and share data.
