# Machine Learning

### The Machine learning model: 
RandomForest classifier (RFC) from ML sklearn library

### Training and testing set:  
Dates (broken into month and year), PHU (public health unit), location, number of Covid cases resolved and death cases per PHU.

### Target: 
Active cases.
The model is going to predict PHUs with high active cases to help the government for allocating budgets. 

### The reasons for choosing the ML model: 
The model has high accuracy and is robust to outliers. There are also low correlations in features that requires multiple learning algorithms.
