## Communication protocol:
A group chat has been set up in Slack.  This will be the primary platform for ongoing correspondence by each team member while working on our individual roles for each segment.  Every Monday and Wednesday evenings will be an opportunity to meet via zoom and discussing the current week's agenda.  Every Sunday the team will connect via Google Meet as well to finalize the submission of the current week.  Additional meetings will be set up throughout the week when needed.<br>
